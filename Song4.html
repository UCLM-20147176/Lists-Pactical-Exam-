        <h1>Bones</h1>
        <p>Song by Imagine Dragons</p>
        <p>Gimme, gimme, gimme some time to think<br>
                I'm in the bathroom, looking at me<br>
                Face in the mirror is all I need (ooh)<br>
                Wait until the reaper takes my life<br>
                Never gonna get me out alive<br>
                I will live a thousand million lives (ooh)<br>
                My patience is waning<br>
                Is this entertaining?<br>
                Our patience is waning<br>
                Is this entertaining?<br>
                I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know<br>
                Where I'm losing all control<br>
                'Cause there's magic in my bones<br>
                I-I-I got this feeling in my soul<br>
                Go ahead and throw your stones<br>
                'Cause there's magic in my bones<br>
                Playing with a stick of dynamite<br>
                There was never gray in black and white<br>
                There was never wrong 'til there was right (ooh, oh)<br>
                Feeling like a boulder hurtling<br>
                Seeing all the vultures circling<br>
                Burning in the flames I'm working in<br>
                Turning in a bed that's darkening<br>
                My patience is waning<br>
                Is this entertaining?<br>
                Our patience is waning<br>
                Is this entertaining?<br>
                I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know<br>
                Where I'm losing all control<br>
                'Cause there's magic in my bones (in my bones)<br>
                I-I-I got this feeling in my soul<br>
                Go ahead and throw your stones<br>
                'Cause there's magic in my bones<br>
                'Cause there's magic in my bones<br>
                Look in the mirror of my mind<br>
                Turning the pages of my life<br>
                Walking the path so many paced a million times<br>
                Drown out the voices in the air
                Leaving the ones that never cared<br>
                Picking the pieces up and building to the sky<br>
                My patience is waning<br>
                Is this entertaining?<br>
                My patience is waning<br>
                Is this entertaining?<br>
                I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know<br>
                Where I'm losing all control<br>
                'Cause there's magic in my bones (magic in my bones)<br>
                I-I-I got this feeling in my soul (soul)<br>
                Go ahead and throw your stones<br>
                'Cause there's magic in<br>
                There goes my mind (I-I-I)<br>
                Don't mind<br>
                There goes my mind (there it goes, there it goes)<br>
                There goes my mind (I-I-I)<br>
                Don't mind (there it goes)<br>
                There goes my mind<br>
                'Cause there's magic in my bones<br>
